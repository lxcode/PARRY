PARRY UUO AND INPUT/OUTPUT DOCUMENTATION

FILES READ DURING LOADING OF PARRY CORE IMAGE: (note -- all are read by LISP)

CHANGE -- list of about 20  changes to make FRONT data and PDAT data compatible
PDATB -- list of useful info from PDAT
BEL -- list of beliefs used by the inferencer
INF -- list of inferences used by the inferencer
RDATA -- data from old parry used by OPAR

  read by FRONT:

NEARBY.KEY	Pairs of neighboring keys on keyboard for respeller
STARTR.ALF	Words which start fragments
STOPPR.ALF	Words which stop fragments
FLAGS.ALF	Words with special functions
IRREG.ALF	Irregular verbs, known misspellings and contractions
SUFFIX.ALF	Word suffixes
IDIOM.ALF	Idiomatic substitutions
FILLER.PAT	Non-vital patterns
NEGATE.PAT	Patterns with opposite meanings
DAD.PAT		Patterns specific to father
MOM.PAT		Patterns specific to mother
FAMLY.PAT	Patterns referring to family

WHILE PARRY IS RUNNING:

ALL.PAR -- tables, read in dump mode.  this file is always open.
	The ultimate origin of ALL.PAR is:
	SYNONM.ALF	Words recognized and synonyms
	SPATS.SEL	Simple sentence patterns
	CPATS.SEL	Compound sentence patterns
	PDATX.PAR	Index to PDAT 
PDAT -- memory data, read with a CHSETI (a LISP 1.6 function). this file 
	is always open	
ERR.FIL -- read in, incremented, and written out to get a number for Pnnn.ERR
Pnnn.ERR --  written whenever an error occurs
PAR2.FIL -- read in, incremented, and written out to get a number for Pnnn.DIA
Pnnn.DIA -- opened, appended to with another i/o pair, and closed for each i/o pair

Things to note:

ALL.PAR either needs a dump mode read, or needs to be in core all the time.
  Perhaps with a paging system (a la SUMEX) it could be in core all the time.
PDAT needs a CHSETI (or equivalent).  This is not now in ILISP (that I know of).
  This could be written in Fail, or implemented in ILISP.
ALL.PAR and PDAT are open all the time (to save lookups and opens), so the
  open must be done at an initialization (PDAT) or flagged so it is done for
  the first read (ALL.PAR).
USETI and CHSETI are also used to get input questions from large files.

Pnnn.DIA must be closed every time, and be appended to.  The everytime closure
  could be avoided with the proper buffer writing and keeping in Fail, to save
  lookups and enters.  The append is in LISP 1.6, but not in ILISP (that I know of).



*******   UUOs   *************************************

UUOs that Parry uses and needs:

DATE -- get system date
TIMER -- get system time
IN -- dump mode read (called DUMPI in TENEX)
USETI & CHSETI -- as noted above


UUOs that Parry uses and could be replaced by LISP functions:

RUNTIM -- time since job started


UUOs that Parry uses and maybe are extravagent:

GETPPN -- get the ppn of this job
GETLIN -- get the tty characteristics of this job (determines type of console)
SWAP -- swaps in another program
SLEEP -- sleep (was for windows)
SNEAK -- see if anything in tty buffer (windows)
INCHAR -- read a character from tty input buffer (windows)
GETNAM-SETNAM -- change the job name to count other Parrys
NAMEIN -- counts number of other Parrys


UUOs currently in LISP 1.6 but not in ILISP but that we need:

CHSETI -- to read in PDAT
CHSETO and INOUT mode in LISP -- to append to a file


PDAT  --  EXPLANATION

THE DATA FILE

IS USUALLY CALLED PDAT OR WITH A NUMBER APPENDED

IT SITS ON DISK IN TV FORMAT


   THE DATA FILE CONTAINS INFO LIKE THIS 
(B 1170 100 (LOCATION I HOSPITAL)
	KEYWDS (HOSPITAL (WHERE))     (for old parry)
	LIT ((NIL. 23))
	SQR ((I.76)(HOSPITAL.33))
)
		(if a question has been asked, which slot of semantic unit 17 is
		being queried? The response is found as the cdr of the dotted pair
		whose car is the slot value.

(E 2730  ANAPH ((WHY.22)(WHO.34))
	EXH T   means go to the exhaust list  ("I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU...")
		none means keep repeating this set of responses
	NORMAL   
	       ( (I AM IN THE HOSPITAL) ((THERE.HOSPITAL)(HOWLONG.13))
		...
	      )
	EMBD    
	       ( (WHERE I AM) (etc. anaphora))
)

The anaphora list has the form: ((anaphword.translation)...) (ie. do an ASSOC of
an anaphoric reference to get its current meaning. Thus ASSOC('THERE,!ANAPHLIST)
would probably return 'HOSPITAL.

(***  THIS IS A COMMENT )

DOCUMENTATION FOR THE RANDOM DISK READ OF PDAT

PDAT WILL REMAIN A FILE WHICH WILL BE EDITED IN TV FORMAT

INDEX WILL BE RUN ON IT TO CREATE AN INDEX FILE

THE INDEX FILE WILL LOOK LIKE:
	(0001 <NUMBER> )
	(0001 <NUMBER> )
	...
  WHERE THE NUMBER WILL BE (IN DIGITS): cccccccccccc
 		THE c BEING THE CHARACTER
		NUMBER OF THE DESIRED S-EXPR (STARTING AT 0)

	to get the record number, divide by octal 1200 and add 1 


TO MAKE THE INDEX: 
  TRY PINDEX
  REN PDATXPDAT.NDX

FIX.DOC

*** THINK ABOUT FIXING THESE:

5235 AND 5168 ARE IN SPATS, BUT NOT PDAT


CHANGE PUNT REPLIES
*SB OK* CHANGE SENSREPLIES ("GOOD")
*SB OK* MAKE PARRY SENSITIVE TO HOMOSEXUALITY
*SB OK* MAKE SURE THE "OK" IN THE SUMEX FILE ALLOWS TRACING EVERYTHING
*SB OK* 2860 (OR SOMETHING) IN PDATZ CALLS "BEL" AND IT SB "BL"


  ** IN THE SCHEDULER:

DAILY MESSAGE

PUT IN INSTRUCTIONS AS TO PURPOSE OF INTERVIEW.



*SB OK * PARRY2 NEEDS A FILE TO READ, IN ORDER TO RUN, AND THEN DELETES IT.

*SB OK* ONLY ONE NUMBER AT THE FRONT OF SUMEX DIA FILES



*** MAYBE WONT GET TO THESE EITHER:

BACKSPACE OR RUBOUT AT SUMEX IS SOMETHING ELSE?

FOR SUMEX - NO 'S ON ERR OUTPUT

SUMEX MORE THAN ONE LINE ON PRINTOUT DOESNT HAVE LINEFEEDS INSERTED

*DONE* DISPLAY COMMANDS OUT -- USE ONLY ESC I

DETERMINE WHERE YOU ARE, DISCONTINUE, MIDDLE OF A PROCESS

ALL *.FIL FILES ON ONE FILE

DMAFIA SETS UP PMAFIA INTENTION ONE IO PAIR TOO LATE



*** PROBABLY WONT EVER FIX THESE:

NAMECHECK ONLY ALLOWS PARRY TO SAY HIS NAME IF "YOU" AND "NAME" ARE IN THE INPUT.

 DOC_NAME_FLAG HAS THE DOCTORS NAME IF GIVEN, HAS T IS A DOCTOR, ELSE NIL

TAKE OUT REFS TO LOOKS

2912 NEEDS A SEMANTIC FN I THINK

WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE MAFIA, SHOULD SET UP ANAPH: THEY=MAFIA

LESS OBLIST, SPECIAL NAMES, LAP NAMES?

MORE SHOULD GET BY ANGERFEARMODE -- LIKE I AM YOUR DOCTOR

WHO ARE THEY VS. WHO IS THE MAFIA -- ANAPH THEY IS GETTING SET
  BEFORE THE DISTINCTION IS MADE

SPECIAL 'S WHICH NEED SPECIAL ROUTINES: 0572 0620 1774 3200



SOME KNOWN BUT   FOUND BUGS:

* FIXED BY TESTING BEFORE CLOSING THE FILE * TO_FILE WILL RETURN THE WRONG DIACHARNO 
    (GETS A NEGATIVE NUMBER SOMEHOW)
 AND THEN SCREW UP THE NEXT TIME.
 THIS HAPPENS AFTER A LOT OF INTERVIEW.  IT MIGHT BE CAUSED BY A FILE
 OF EXACTLY 512 CHARS(NO), OR TOO LITTLE FS OR FW SPACE.

*FIXED*SOMETHING PRINTS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING (RETURNS NO ANSWER IN !OUTPUT)
 THIS HAPPENS TOWARDS THE END OF A LONG INTERVIEW

*FIXED* GET_STORY (ACTUALLY FLSTMT) WILL GO FROM A BOOKIE LEADIN TO A RACKET
 LEADIN TO A MAFIA LEADIN WITHOUT STOPPING TO TELL ABOUT EACH TOPIC

*FIXED -- IT NOW MEANS JUST A SPECIFIC OBJECT OR CONCEPT *
ADDING "IT" TO THE ANAPHLIST SCREWS UP BY LEAVING GARBAGE IN  "IT".

*BYPASSED* BOOKIE ARGUMENT, THEN "DID HE" LEADS TO GOON RATHER THAN THEYDO.

* DOESNT HAPPEN ANYMORE* SOMETIMES AN ANAPH ( LIKE YOU_DO ) WILL RETURN THE 
 RESPONSE TO THAT ANAPH  ( LIKE "WHAT I DID" ) RATHER THAN GETTING AN ANAPH .

MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS ABOUT ERRORS AND RUNNING  ****   LISP  ****

IF MLISP GIVES YOU A MISSING SEMICOLON AFTER EXPRESSION
	AND CURRENT SYMBOL IS .  (AT END OF PROGRAM)
  THEN YOU LEFT OUT AN END SOMEWHERE

DO (DSKIN SYS: UTILS) ONLY AFTER ALL BIN PROG LOADED IN ---
	IT SCREWS UP BPEND

WHEN  DIRECTORY FULL  HAPPENS, YOU MIGHT HAVE 2 JOBS LOGGED IN
  ATTEMPTING TO READ OR WRITE THE SAME FILE.

IF YOU DO R LISP, AND INC UNDEFINED FUNCTION, THEN THE LISP CORE IMAGE
  IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH.

WHEN AN MLISP TRANSLATION QUITS WITHOUT GENERATING ANY CODE
  THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE A ' IN A LIST SOMEWHERE INTENDING FOR IT TO
  BE AN APOSTROPHE, BUT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ?'

DIAGNOSTICS: 
( <PERFORMANCE>  <LIST OF NEW INFERENCES>  <CURRENT INTENTION>  )

PERFORMANCE:

OK -- good pattern, good response

SPECIALANAPH -- good pattern (the pattern is a special anaph)
  good anaph in memory from the previous sentence

NOSPECIALANAPH -- good pattern (the pattern is a special anaph)
  no anaph from the previous output to answer this input

NOPATTERN -- there is no pattern that matched this input

NOT_IN_MEMORY -- good pattern, no response in memory for this pattern

KEYWORD -- no pattern, so the keyword scan found a keyword and used
  it to guess at a response

MISC -- everything else failed, so a miscellaneous response was used

GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS DOCTOR LOVE. HOW ARE YOU?
COULD YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME.
ARE YOU A MAN OR A WOMAN.
HOW OLD ARE YOU.
THIRTY FOUR. WHERE DO YOU COME FROM.
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING.
DO YOU ENJOY WORKING THERE.
HOW MUCH DO YOU GET PAID AN HOUR.
ARE YOU MARRIED.

HOW IS YOUR HEALTH.
HOW MUCH DO YOU DRINK.
HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN DRUGS.
DO YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE SLEEPING.
HAVE YOU EVER HAD VISIONS.

IF YOU AREN'T, THEN WHY ARE YOU IN THE HOSPITAL.
BY WHAT.
TELL ME MORE.
NO, WHAT ABOUT BOOKIES.
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED.
DID HE GET EVEN WITH YOU.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS.
WHO.
WHY DO THEY SPY ON YOU.
WHY DO THEY WANT TO FRAME YOU.
WHAT IS YOUR EVIDENCE.
WHO IS HE.
HAVE YOU TOLD THE POLICE.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT.

DOES THE MAFIA KNOW YOU ARE IN THE HOSPITAL.
WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP YOU OUT OF THIS SITUATION.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OUR CONVERSATION SO FAR.
I AM SORRY THAT IT HASNT BEEN BETTER.
WHAT SHOULD I ASK ABOUT.

IT SOUNDS BELIEVABLE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME?

I FIND YOU INTERESTING.
DO YOU EVER FEEL UNREAL.
DO YOU SEE THINGS THAT OTHERS DON'T SEEM TO SEE.
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION.
ARE YOU ALWAYS THIS WAY.
YOU APPEAR TO BE VERY SICK.

DO YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH YOUR HEALTH?
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

DO YOU NEED TO HAVE PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT.
AREN'T YOU GETTING TREATMENT THERE NOW?

HOW DO YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ME?

THANK YOU FOR TALKING WITH ME.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GOODBYE.
