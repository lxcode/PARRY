	TITLE PINDEX

;PINDEX IS A PROGRAM WHICH READS A PARRY DATA FILE AND CREATES A RANDOM-ACCESS INDEX
;FOR THIS FILE.
;A NEW INDEX ENTRY IS GENERATED FOR EACH OCCURRENCE OF A SPECIAL CHARACTER IN
;THE INPUT FILE. THIS SPECIAL CHARACTER IS CURRENTLY # AND IS ASSUMED TO OCCUR
;ONLY IN THE FOLLOWING CONTEXT: (#X KKKKK ...
;KKKKK BECOMES THE INDEX ENTRY KEY. THE VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS KEY IS THE
;CHARACTER NUMBER, N, OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING (, AS COUNTED FROM THE BEGINNING
;OF THE FILE. THUS, THE FILE RECORD NUMBER OF THE INDEX ENTRY IS N/1200
;(1200 OCTAL), AND THE CHARACTER NUMBER WITHIN THIS RECORD IS N MOD 1200.
;THE OUTPUT INDEX FILE HAS THE FORM
;
;		(KKKKK . NNNNNNNNNNNN)
;		 .
;		 .
;		 .
;		NIL
;
;WHERE KKKKK IS THE KEY AND NNNNNNNNNNNN IS THE OCTAL CHARACTER NUMBER.
